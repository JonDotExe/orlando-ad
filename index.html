      How’s an alligator road trip sound? Yeah, thought so. Head to the
      <strong>Lake Apopka Wildlife Trail</strong> and experience REAL Florida.
      There are loads of gators, birds, turtles, and fish to see on this free
      (Yes, free) 11-mile nature drive. So, roll down the windows, turn down
      the radio and take in the view. (Open Friday – Sunday only.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Here’s something else they’ll go wild over. Take them to the crystal-clear
      waters of <strong>Blue Spring State Park</strong> for a sight they’ll
      never forget—hundreds of manatees in their natural habitat. A boardwalk
      with observation bridges offers you and the kids a chance to watch these
      gentle sea creatures and their babies as they swim, socialize, and even
      snooze. <strong>$6</strong> will get you and your carload of kids in for
      the day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Need a “paws” after all the amusement rides? For the price of a cup of
      joe, the kiddies can canoodle with kittens at <strong>Orlando’s Cat Café</strong>.
      Located just 4 miles from Disney’s Animal Kingdom, this hangout for cool
      cats (usually you’ll find 12–20 ready to meet and greet on any given day)
      requires reservations. Premium teas, pastries, and paninis along with
      coffee are served throughout the day. 1 hour of petting and play is
      <strong>$10</strong>.
    </p>

      Think the less you pay, the more watered down your options are? Think again.
      The natural oasis just miles from downtown Orlando at <strong>Wekiwa Springs State Park</strong>
      is bubbling over with fun. The family can chill in the spring’s cool, clear
      water—it’s a perfect 72°F year-round—or opt to explore the lush grounds
      that come with tons of trails and outdoor activities. Either way, the price
      is just <strong>$6 per carload</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      And while we’re on the subject of water, the <strong>Swans on Lake Eola</strong>
      have got to be on your budget bucket list. You can take a stroll around the
      lake’s paved walkway and admire these beauties from shore or choose to feed
      them for <strong>$0.25</strong> a pop. For a bit more excitement, rent a
      swan-shaped pedal boat for 30 minutes at <strong>$15</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, you can always hit the beach for a cheap day out. Just an hour
      away is Florida’s iconic <strong>Cocoa Beach</strong>. There’s parking,
      picnic benches, restrooms, showers, and plenty of sand and surf. All you
      have to spring for is the gas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not in the mood to fight traffic? Just grab a towel and head over to our
      own <strong>River Island Waterpark</strong>. It’s just steps away. You and
      the kids can bob down the lazy river, take a dip in the pool, or zip down
      the waterslides without ever leaving the grounds.

      So, where else to take the kids that isn’t going to cost a lot? Consider
      giving <strong>Semoran Skateway</strong> in Casselberry a whirl. This retro
      roller rink offers daily deals and special events like “Old Skool Jams” on
      Saturday nights and “Family Fun Night” on Tuesdays. Prices run about
      <strong>$9 per skater</strong> most days.
    </p>

    <p>
      Or, how about grabbing a seat on Orlando’s <strong>StarFlyer Tower</strong>
      for a 450 ft thrill ride you’ll never forget? If you’re afraid the ticket
      price will hold you back, not to worry—this spin will only set you back
      <strong>$10</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then there’s this: pile the kids into the back of your SUV and head to
      Lakeland for a throwback family outing that’s sure to please. Only one of
      four drive-ins left in the state, the <strong>Silver Moon Theatre</strong>
      shows first-run movies—double features every night of the week. Prices
      range from <strong>free for ages 0–3</strong> and <strong>$8 for ages 10+</strong>.

      Who wants pancakes? The batter’s up at the <strong>Old Spanish Sugar Mill Pancake House</strong>
      inside De Leon Springs State Park where you and the kids can cook your own
      pancakes with yummy add-ons and toppings right at your table. The price for
      these all-you-can-eat pancake stacks? <strong>$7.99</strong>, served with
      maple syrup, molasses, and honey. (Park entry is <strong>$6 per vehicle</strong>—
      plan a day trip: paddle the lake for a bit before your pancake feast.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The massive, handmade cookies found at <strong>Gideon’s Bakehouse</strong>
      in East End Market aren’t just a must-see—they’re a must-have. Stuffed to
      the max, made from scratch, and weighing in at half a pound each, these
      ah-mazing cookies may be hefty, but the price isn’t. Just
      <strong>$6 apiece</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      There you have it. Proof big fun doesn’t have to come with a big price tag.
      But make no mistake—this is only a start. There’s plenty more to see and
      do to make price LESS vacation memories in Orlando.
